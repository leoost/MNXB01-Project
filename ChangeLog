28/10 : Project initialized. (Mattias)
30/10 : Skeleton code and datasets uploaded. (Mattias)
31/10 : Creation of the function that reads the data from the provided files. (Mattias, Leo, Magnus)
01/11: Managed to eliminate the bad lines from the vector created from the data. (Mattias, Leo, Magnus)
01/11: Extracted relevant data from raw data, e.g.  temperature, date etc. Wrote data to a readable .dat file. (Leo, Magnus)
02/11: Managed to make the previous code work as intended for every dataset other than Uppsala, as that is a different type. (Herman, Leo,  Magnus)
02/11: Created tempPerDay that averages the temperature every day over a given year. (Mattias, Herman, Leo, Magnus)
03/11: Have a code that at least produces a graph, though not necessarily the one we want. (Leo, Herman)
03/11: Succesfully made a histogram of multiple datasets. (Leo, Herman)
03/11: Created tempPerDayExtended function that averages temp of every day from every year. (Magnus, Mattias)
03/11: Succesfully plotted tempPerDayExtended and have the current code in working format. (Leo, Magnus, Mattias)
03/11: Added legends to the plots in the previous stable version. (Leo)
